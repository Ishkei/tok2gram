# Sprint Status Template
# Use this template as the basis for generating `sprint-status.yaml`.
# Replace placeholders with generation-time values or have your automation fill them.

generated: "{date}"
project: "{project_name}"
project_key: "{project_key}"
tracking_system: "{tracking_system}" # e.g., file-system, jira
story_location: "{story_location}"     # e.g., docs/stories/

# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created, ready for development
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Implementation complete, ready for review
#   - done: Story completed

development_status:
  # Epics (example)
  epic-1: backlog
  epic-2: backlog

  # Story keys (example format: {epic}-{storynum}-{short-title})
  # Replace or programmatically populate this section with all story keys from epics.
  # Example entries:
  # 1-1-load-configuration-and-creators: backlog
  # 1-2-fetch-latest-posts-from-tiktok: backlog

  # Retrospectives (optional)
  # epic-1-retrospective: optional

# Notes:
# - Automation should produce a concrete list of epics and story keys under `development_status`.
# - When the first story of an epic moves to `ready-for-dev` or `in-progress`, consider updating the epic status to `in-progress`.
# - Keep this template under version control and use it as the canonical output format for sprint-planning.
