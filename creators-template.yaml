# TikTok Creators Configuration
# 
# Each creator entry supports the following fields:
# - username (required): The TikTok username
# - chat_id (required): The Telegram chat ID to send posts to
# - user_id (optional): The numeric TikTok user ID. Use this for accounts with privacy
#   settings that prevent username-based API lookups. When provided, the user_id will be
#   used instead of the username for fetching posts.
#
# Example with username only:
#   - username: "exampleuser"
#     chat_id: "-1001234567890"
#
# Example with user_id (for private/restricted accounts):
#   - username: "privateuser"
#     user_id: "1234567890123456789"
#     chat_id: "-1001234567890"
